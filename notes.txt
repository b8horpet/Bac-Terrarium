Overview:
Game is a puzzle like environment in a petri-dish. Goal is making the desired bacterium survive while others not. The win condition can vary.
Map is a grid (hex) that can contain cells. There are environmental factors: food, anti-biotics, etc... that influence a cell.
Bacteria use up food to get energy, use energy for existing and can reproduce when has enough energy for that.
Player is a benevolent "force" that helps the experiment to succeed. Can manipulate the world indirectly (placing barriers and anti biotics for now)

TODO:
Immediate:
anti-biotics interaction is 1 sided, there is no resistance
cell division is not realistic, should be split in exact halves
rules are underspecified and rely too much on random factor
in fact, randomness shall be eliminated almost entirely to make it more puzzle like

Later:
polish interactions, add anims and sound effects
make transitions between levels, level selector?
make tutorial levels
make story art and screens between levels
add input customization
